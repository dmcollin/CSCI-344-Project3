Goal
Using Node.js, Redis, the Twitter API, Express and (optionally) Socket.io to write a program that keeps track of links and words that appear associated with them in tweets.

Display the results to the user in some way using the Express web framework.

For example, a bare minimum for this project might be a program that keeps track of all the links that appear with the word 'awesome' and then presents the 'awesomest' links to the user.
